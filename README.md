# SQLTraining

To start project you have to extract data from ZIP and open SLN file with the help of Microsoft Visual Studio.

In the project were used 2 DataBases: one created by me and NorthWind downloaded from the link below 
https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs

To start the project correctly you should install NorthWind on PC and connect it to the project
with the help of tools Server Explorer and SQL Server Object Explorer.

Now you can run and modify code without any issues.
